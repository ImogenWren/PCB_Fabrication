Tax Code for UK Import: 8534001100

*I was looking on the government website for the appropriate tax code for importing PCB’s and think the Tax code appears to be: 8534001100
Found here https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/8534001100
There seems to be a calculator for tax here

This code should avoid paying import tax but VAT would still need to be added.
I would recommend both putting this code in the notes requesting it be added when making an order outside of the UK and asking for the company used supplying the PCB’s that the parcel is labelled with the code to avoid being held at customs. There may be an appropriate import declarations form such as the CN22 to use but I have not investigated this yet.

I’m not sure this form would be the correct one as it is used for sending stuff out of the UK using royal mail."*
